# Surfers Co.
This demo project is developed with Bedrock (6.4.3) and Sage (10.8.8), two powerful tools for creating advanced WordPress sites. It is based on the PSD "Surfers Co." by Luis Costa.

## Plugins
* Advanced Custom Fields Pro 6.2.5
* Gravity Forms 2.7.19
* WooCommerce 8.5.2
* Yoast SEO 21.9.1

## WARNING
* Use this project only as coding reference, not as something to take seriously
* When you'll build and configure it for the first time, you won't see anything: plugins are not activated by default, there's only the surfersco theme, dump SQL file is not provided. I'll fix that.
